# RFM-Model-Clustering-Analysis
This model evaluates customer be￾havior based on three key metrics: recency, which assesses how recently a customer has made a purchase; frequency, which measures the rate of customer transactions; and monetary, which gauges the total monetary value of a customer’s transactions. RFM facilitates the identification of buyer characteristics that influence response.
